print(10 > 3)  # this represents 10 being greater than 3
# this will return True as this is a boolean expression
print(10 >= 3)  # this is greater than or equal to, also True
print(10 < 20)  # 10 is less than 20, also True
print(10 <= 20)  # less than or eqial to 20, also True
# fmt: off
print(10 == 20)  # equal to, this one would be False (equality opertor is 2 equal signs ==)
print(10 == "10")  # this would be False as the computer see str and int different, so these two are technically to equal
# fmt: on
print(10 != 10)  # this is NOT equal !=, hence this would be a False statement

# we can do this on strings as well, for example
print("bag" > "apple")  # this returns true since bag come after apple alphabetically
print("bag" == "BAG")  # this would return false as its case sensitive
