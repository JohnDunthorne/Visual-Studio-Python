x = input("x: ")
# this will crate a viriable based on user input for x
y = x + 1
# this will error at run as the x input will be a str and y is adding a int to it it

# we can type convert inputs to different things for example
int(x)  # to convert x to an integer
float(x)  # to convert x to float
bool(x)  # to convert x to a boolean
str(x)  # to convert x to a string
