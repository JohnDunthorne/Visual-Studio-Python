# there are 3 types of numbers python deals with, integer, float and complex numbers

# integers are whole numbers
x = 1

# floats are numbers with decimal points
y = 2.3

# complex numbers are something more common with engineers
z = 1 + 2j  # j being an imaginary number (like i in mathematics)

print(f"{x} {y} {z}")

# python contains all the standard aritmatic operations that we use in math

a = 1 + 2  # addition
b = 2 - 1  # subtraction
c = 3 * 3  # multiplication
d = 16 / 2  # division
e = 16 // 2  # double slash will return an integer automatically

print(f"{a} {b} {c} {int(d)}")
# i wrote int(d) so the number gets represented by an integer rather than a float
print(e)
